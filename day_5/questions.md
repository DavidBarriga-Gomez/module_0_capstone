## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array in Ruby?
hashes have keys and values while arrays are indexed.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {dog_food: 100, cat_food: 101}

1. given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states["IA"]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  All the values?
states

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In this case, why is a hash better than an array?
If we want values by a name it would be much easier to find them rather than scanning through an array and looking for its indexed value.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
syntax.
